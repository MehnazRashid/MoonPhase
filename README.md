# Moon Phase 🌙

Moon Phase is a website that shows the current phase of the moon. Upon visiting the site, one can see what today's moon looks like in the sky. We used Flask to create this web app, and the design was implemented using HTML and CSS. The app calculates the current moon phase and displays an image that corresponds to the moon's current cycle.


To calculate the moon phase, we use a specific formula based on the Julian Date (JD) and the lunar cycle. The formula helps determine how many days have passed in the current lunar cycle, which is then used to identify the moon's phase.
